Dear Mr. Patterson,

I am writing to request a temporary leave due to health concerns. I am committed to taking the necessary time off to ensure a swift recovery. According to my private doctor, the leave is required from May 10, 2053, to May 28, 2053.

Please be assured that upon my return, I will prioritize catching up on all the pending tasks and ensuring everything is handled efficiently. I am committed to returning to work on May 28, 2053, and resuming my regular duties.

If there are any urgent matters that require attention during my leave, please feel free to contact me via email. I will make myself available to address any critical issues.

Thank you for understanding my situation. I greatly appreciate your support and cooperation.

Sincerely,

Aaron Shelton
